    "* **Logic:** Products were initially classified by applying comprehensive regular expressions (`pat` variables) against the product **`name`** field.\n",
    "* **Goal:** To capture the vast majority of clearly identifiable products (e.g., \"Coca Cola\" for \"Soft Drink\").\n",
    "* **Result:** Ambiguously named products (e.g., \"Variety Pack 30 Pack 375ml\" or \"Original Lemon 600ml\") that could not be determined solely from the name were temporarily classified into **\"Other drinks\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Pass 2: Re-classification of \"Other drinks\" using Original Category**\n",

    "* **Problem:** After Pass 1, a significant number of products remained in the \"Other drinks\" bucket (e.g., 340 items in Woolworths initially).\n",
    "* **Logic:** The `category_original` column was then used as a secondary source. A simpler regular expression pass was executed *only* on the products classified as \"Other drinks\" to utilize keywords from the original, retailer-specific category data.\n",
